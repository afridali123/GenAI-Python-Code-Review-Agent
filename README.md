AZURE_PAT=your-azure-devops-pat
AZURE_ORG=your-org-name
AZURE_PROJECT=your-project-name

## Run the Agent

python main.py

## Output Example 
Reviewing /src/utils/helper.py...

--- Review for /src/utils/helper.py ---

1. Summary:
   This file defines utility functions for handling file operations and data formatting.

2. Issues:
   - Uses a hardcoded path which should be parameterized.
   - Lacks exception handling for file operations.

3. Suggestions:
   - Add docstrings for functions.
   - Use pathlib for file paths.

4. Best Practices:
   - Functions are small and focused.
   - Uses list comprehensions effectively.

## 🧩 Extending the Agent
✅ Add Git PR integration (comment reviews automatically)

✅ Store reviews in Markdown or PDF

✅ Add a simple Streamlit or Flask UI

✅ Review only files changed in a given commit
